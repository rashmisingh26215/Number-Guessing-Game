# Number-Guessing-Game

The project is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Here are the key features of the game:

User Interface: The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing components such as JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, and JButton.

Gameplay: The user enters their guess into a text field and clicks the "Submit" button to check if their guess matches the target number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Attempts and Score: The game keeps track of the number of attempts made by the user. The user earns points based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.

Play Again: After completing the game or reaching the maximum number of attempts, the user can choose to play again by clicking the "Play Again" button. This resets the game and generates a new random number for the user to guess.

Visual Feedback: The game provides visual feedback to the user using text labels to display messages and feedback on their guesses.

Overall, the Number Guessing Game offers an interactive and enjoyable experience for users to test their guessing skills and try to achieve a high score within the given number of attempts.
